# ai.docs
Assorted AI documentation.


# General
- Machine Learning for Everyone (some sort of "for dummies" guide)<br>
  _In simple words. With real-world examples_<br>
  https://vas3k.com/blog/machine_learning/
- How To Learn Data Science If You’re Broke.<br>
  https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-learn-data-science-if-youre-broke-7ecc408b53c7 <br>
  Seems to be a very basic, starter, motivational but good introduction to the DataScience world
- Learn AI for Free<br>
  https://blog.goodaudience.com/learn-ai-for-free-5b186cde3990
  Too basic article, just a collection with a bunch of things, useful only to keep all bookmarks in one place
- Lessons from becoming a Machine Learning Engineer in 12 months, without a CS/Math degree<br>
  https://hackernoon.com/lessons-from-becoming-a-machine-learning-engineer-in-12-months-without-a-cs-math-degree-acb308886c95
  Sounds a little bit provocative to me even if I don't think I can achieve all things mentioned here 
  in a 12 month period but assertions and general considerations are well addressed, comments and tips are pertinent.
  Definitively a nice read with a lot of useful links
