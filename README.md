# ai.docs
Assorted AI documentation.

# General
- Machine Learning for Everyone (some sort of "for dummies" guide)<br>
  _In simple words. With real-world examples_<br>
  https://vas3k.com/blog/machine_learning/
- How To Learn Data Science If You’re Broke.<br>
  https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-learn-data-science-if-youre-broke-7ecc408b53c7 <br>
  Seems to be a very basic, starter, motivational but good introduction to the DataScience world
- Learn AI for Free<br>
  https://blog.goodaudience.com/learn-ai-for-free-5b186cde3990
  Too basic article, just a collection with a bunch of things, useful only to keep all bookmarks in one place
- Lessons from becoming a Machine Learning Engineer in 12 months, without a CS/Math degree<br>
  https://hackernoon.com/lessons-from-becoming-a-machine-learning-engineer-in-12-months-without-a-cs-math-degree-acb308886c95
  Sounds a little bit provocative to me even if I don't think I can achieve all things mentioned here 
  in a 12 month period but assertions and general considerations are well addressed, comments and tips are pertinent.
  Definitively a nice read with a lot of useful links

- Machine Learning A To Z, Complete Course by Andrew Ng  
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-58kO_zYUGE  
  An huge video editing mix with the whole Andrew Ng course listed below, 8h but it seems a waste not watching it
- Lex Fridman podcasts  
  https://lexfridman.com/ai/  
  Well known source of quality audio (and video) podcasts from a real geek, mostly focused on AI folks it also has
  outstanding appearances from the whole IT field. A must watch (Bengio, Knuth, Stroustrup, Van Rossum, ...)

# Code
- An open community to promote AI technology.<br>
  https://github.com/tensorlayer <br>
  Take also a look at the excellent seq2seq-chatbot implementation from there

# Courses
- Andrew Ng courses on ML from Coursera<br>
  https://www.deeplearning.ai/ 
- Nice learning courses. All of them are free, cool and without ads<br>
  http://www.fast.ai/
- Free Online Courses in Data Science<br>
  https://www.class-central.com/subject/data-science <br>
  Massive list of them, well organized and useful
- Grow with Google<br>
  https://grow.google/intl/europe<br>
  An interesting amount of links, resources, training courses and documentation for google certified courses.
  It's not strictly AI related but seems nice spend some time with them
- Machine Learning Crash Course<br>
  https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/<br>
  A self-study guide for aspiring machine learning practitioners, this Machine Learning Crash Course features
  a series of lessons with video lectures, real-world case studies, and hands-on practice exercises
- Learn Machine Learning in 3 Months  
  https://github.com/llSourcell/LearnML  
  Well... probably, as usual, Siraj is somewhat too optimistic and learning ML without a solid Stats and Math base
  might be too harsh. But even if it takes 1Y is still good enough, all linked resources are excellent.
