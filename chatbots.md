# Chatbots
- Chatbots with Machine Learning
  - https://blog.statsbot.co/chatbots-machine-learning-e83698b1a91e<br>
    Using machine learning approaches to build smart chatbots, it's just a primer but a good starting point
- Contextual Chatbots with Tensorflow
  - https://chatbotsmagazine.com/contextual-chat-bots-with-tensorflow-4391749d0077<br>
    Build a chatbot framework using Tensorflow with some context handling
- Say Hello to Red Samurai Contextual Chatbot with TensorFlow Deep Neural Network Learning
  - https://medium.com/oracledevs/say-hello-to-red-samurai-contextual-chatbot-with-tensorflow-deep-neural-network-learning-aa69dd3be04f<br>
    Something like "Contextual chatbots with tensorflow" so not that original.
    Pretty well explained description based on that sample

- How to Build Your First Chatbot
  - https://tutorials.botsfloor.com/how-to-build-your-first-chatbot-c84495d4622d<br>
    Probably not your first bot as stated in the title, information are really good but deeply technical for a beginner.
    The way to go when you have learnt something good and you pretty understand not just the basics. Link to github repo for full source
